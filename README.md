This is a micro-mini project that demonstrates how to create foundationally stable tables, using only CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. There are zero dependencies required and the only library used is DataTables, documentation for which can be found at https://datatables.net/manual/ 

I've seen a lot of dirty, difficult to use tables in a lot of frontends and this little project is part of my ongoing efforts to encourage myself and others to develop the habit of creating clean and maintanable code that allows for beautiful frontend expression of backend data.

Happy coding
